# User Story

```
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes.

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before.

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

# Business Context

* For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. 

* Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.


# Technology :

**1. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)** :

* Web Applications : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

* Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.

**2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** : 

* Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 

* A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 

* Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

**3. [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)** : Creates random unique id's.

# Usage :

* The application will be invoked with the following command: This will start localhost server on PORT 3000.

```
node server.js
```

* Open browser and type `http://localhost:3000/` to run this application on your local machine.

# Features :

1. Used 'Express.js' to build server

2. Used 'fs(File System)' module to read and write from 'db.json' file.

3. Used [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) npm package to give unique id to each note.

4. Application is deployed on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) : Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.
